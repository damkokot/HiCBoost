# project-template
A project template for work.

General structure:
* `config/` directory contains configuration information, including the central `config.yml` file.
* `data/` directory contains all the source and processed data.
* `doc/` directory contains documentation material.
* `env/` directory contains conda environments.
* `results/` directory contains results generated by the data analysis code found in `src/`.
* `src/` directory contains all the code to perform the analyses. It is first divided by programming language, then by workflow.

Note that all paths used in the project should be relative to the main
project directory. Also all the programs should be run from there, e.g.
`src/sh/test.sh`. See `./run_snakemake.sh` for an example Snakemake
invocation.

Usage instructions:
* clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/ajank/project-template.git`)
* remove the .git subdirectory
* update the absolute project path in config/config.yml
* replace these instructions with a brief description of your very own project
* commit as a new repository to GitHub.
